# Data-Mining: Assignment 1

This zip file contains two files: 
- classification.py
- report.pdf

classification.py contains code capable of performing classification on the Eclipse bug data set. The classification methods consist of a single decision tree; 
a bagging of trees; and a random forest. The algorithms mainly rely on the following four functions: tree_grow(), tree_pred(), tree_grow_b(), and tree_pred_b(). 
Additional helper functions and classes are present in this code file as well. 

All findings are presented and discussed in report.pdf. Moreover, a description of the dataset is reported.
